Therefore, it’s important to ensure that all the documents required are submitted and the references should be accessible and easy to contact.

Private employees are members of the Social Security System because the law mandates it, and so, the agency is their initial source of help when financial crisis comes. Commonly, SSS salary loans are availed of, but the agency also offers other types of loan such as housing and business loans.</p>\n<p class="lead">When you apply for an <strong>SSS loan online</strong> you need to be a member with 36 monthly contributions for a one-month salary loan with a 10% interest rate per annum. On the other hand with Loansolutions, you only need to be currently employed for at least 1 year to avail of a loan for up to 5 years term. However, bank and private financing loans offer 1-2% interest per month or 12-24% per annum, which is bigger than what SSS loan offers.</p>\n<p class="lead">If you want to check more of the loan, you can apply on their website and fill out an SSS loan form which is downloadable on their website. And for comparison, you can also apply at Loansolutions and fill out our online form no download required.</p>\n<p class="lead">If you still want to explore other loan options, a Pag-ibig Multi-purpose loan is another go to of Filipinos for loans. Although primarily known for housing loan, Pag-ibig also offers salary loans for members who have 24 months worth of contributions. This is way better than <strong>SSS loan</strong> 36 months. Calculations are based on the number of months multiplied by the amount of contribution and the loan factor. Loan factor increases as the amount of the contribution increases. For salary loans, employed members repayment method is through monthly salary deductions.</p>\n<p class="lead"><strong>Bank loan</strong> is another option for people to get financial assistance. Most banks offer personal loans for applicants in need of cash. Since there are only a low percentage of Filipinos who actually go for a bank loan, Loansolutions endeavors to change people’s perception about bank loans and help the unbanked be bank-able. Loansolutions has yet to forge a partnership for an SSS loan or a Pag-ibig loan since the priority has been to move people closer to banks to assist with their banking needs.</p>\n<p class="lead">Currently Loansolutions has a network of bank partners to help us get our borrowers the credit assistance they need. There are two types of bank loans – secured and unsecured loan. Secured type of personal loan is one that requires collateral such as a home or car. Interest rates are usually lower. There is a risk of repossession if the loan is not settled. Unsecured loans do not require collateral but policies are more stringent. Credit history of the loan applicant is checked. Interest rates for personal loans vary. It is best to choose banks that offer flexible, affordable and convenient payment schemes.</p>\n<p class="lead">In the Philippines, it is not difficult to find credit providers. Many Filipinos survive financial difficulties through loans. The difference is the legitimacy of loan providers.

Home equity loan is essentially the use of your home’s value in acquiring a loan. An example of this is a home that costs $100,000. The paid amount for the home was $60, 000 while the owed amount is $40,000. From there, the home equity would therefore be $60,000. In instances such as sudden medical emergencies or college tuition fees, the homeowners have the option of loaning their home equity in order to pay for such expenses. The interest rate from your previous payment is higher when you make a home equity loan but an advantage is that taxes are deducted, making it easier to pay off. This is a once-a-month payment, making it more convenient for the borrower as well. The monthly interest rate or annual percentage rate (APR) is the fixed fee for the services the lender provided. People also question “what is home equity loan for?” There are indeed other options to choose from, but the advantage of home equity loans is the larger amount of money withdrawable and is a relatively faster form of loan since the collateral is the house. It is suitable for those who have a steady line of work to promptly pay off the loan and would only be using the money for a one-off purpose. In the instance the borrower fails to pay, his/her home equity loan would motion the lender to repossess or foreclose the house in order for it to be placed again on the market. This is beneficial for the lender as well because they are able to keep the paid money and repeat the process for future buyers.', 'What is home equity loan?', '', 'publish', 'open', 'closed', '', 'what-is-home-equity-loan', '', '', '2015-12-21 03:42:35', '2015-12-21 03:42:35', '', 0, 'http://localhost/wordpress/?post_type=kbe_knowledgebase&amp;p=66', 0, 'kbe_knowledgebase', '', 0),

In case of default payment or if the loan has not been paid, the lender would have the right to sell it to compensate for the amount that has not been paid.</p>\n<p class="lead">Like any other loan, <strong>chattel mortgage terms</strong> vary from one lending company to another.

We have basic requirements so we can match your data with the requirements that our partners are looking for. Age is a big factor in getting approved for an auto loan. Minimum age is 21, and not over 60 upon the loan’s maturity. This is to safeguard the lender against inability to fully pay the loan. Being a Filipino citizen is also a requirement, but if you are a foreigner, you should be able to show an Alien Certificate of Registration. If you own a business, it must be in operation for at least two years and profiting at least PhP400,000 each year. Should you meet all these, we will now proceed to step 2 which is matching your profile with our partners whose requirements meet your qualifications. If you get matched with more than one lender, you get to pick which one gives the best offer that you can afford. Then wait for a few days for your approval and you can be on your way to your car dealership.</p>\n<p class="lead">Owning a car these days is no longer as hard as it used to in the past several years. Lending investors have made auto loans more accessible to the general public. Gone are the days when only the rich can afford to buy a brand new car. Now even middle-income earners can afford to buy one.

It means that a home’s equity is no longer burdened with debt that can impede its use as collateral.</p>\n\n<h5 class="pt20">HOME EQUITY LOAN</h5>\n<p class="lead">As already mentioned, you can use home equity meaning it can be put up as a security to your home loan without having to shell out additional cash to get approved. The higher the home equity is, the higher the amount of the home loan you can get. A home equity loan is just that. The owner of the home whose equity is to be used as collateral can determine how much of the home’s equity will be used as collateral. The owner of the home will now serve as the guarantor.</p>\n\n<h5 class="pt20">LOANSOLUTIONS WILL HELP YOU REALIZE YOUR DREAM HOME</h5>\n<p class="lead">Now that we have discussed equity meaning for house loan a form can now be filled out at Loansolutions so we can proceed with the succeeding steps in securing your home loan.

It’s basically a personal loan with the valuable as a collateral. Your credit background no longer needs to be checked.

We see to it that you are completely qualified for the loan alternative you will be applying for so you wouldn’t waste your time waiting on a loan application that is sure to be disapproved. If you ever get disapproved, we will extend our assistance again by looking for other lenders.</p>\n<p class="lead">Find the right pawnshop loan alternative that fits your needs with low interest rates and favorable terms.

Private employees are members of the Social Security System because the law mandates it, and so, the agency is their initial source of help when financial crisis comes. Commonly, SSS salary loans are availed of, but the agency also offers other types of loan such as housing and business loans.</p>\n<p>When you apply for an <strong>SSS loan online</strong> you need to be a member with 36 monthly contributions for a one-month salary loan with a 10% interest rate per annum. On the other hand with Loansolutions, you only need to be currently employed for at least 1 year to avail of a loan for up to 5 years term. However, bank and private financing loans offer 1-2% interest per month or 12-24% per annum, which is bigger than what SSS loan offers.</p>\n<p>If you want to check more of the loan, you can apply on their website and fill out an SSS loan form which is downloadable on their website. And for comparison, you can also apply at Loansolutions and fill out our online form no download required.</p>\n<p>If you still want to explore other loan options, a Pag-ibig Multi-purpose loan is another go to of Filipinos for loans. Although primarily known for housing loan, Pag-ibig also offers salary loans for members who have 24 months worth of contributions. This is way better than <strong>SSS loan</strong> 36 months. Calculations are based on the number of months multiplied by the amount of contribution and the loan factor. Loan factor increases as the amount of the contribution increases. For salary loans, employed members repayment method is through monthly salary deductions.</p>\n<p><strong>Bank loan</strong> is another option for people to get financial assistance. Most banks offer personal loans for applicants in need of cash. Since there are only a low percentage of Filipinos who actually go for a bank loan, Loansolutions endeavors to change people’s perception about bank loans and help the unbanked be bank-able. Loansolutions has yet to forge a partnership for an SSS loan or a Pag-ibig loan since the priority has been to move people closer to banks to assist with their banking needs.</p>\n<p>Currently Loansolutions has a network of bank partners to help us get our borrowers the credit assistance they need. There are two types of bank loans – secured and unsecured loan. Secured type of personal loan is one that requires collateral such as a home or car. Interest rates are usually lower. There is a risk of repossession if the loan is not settled. Unsecured loans do not require collateral but policies are more stringent. Credit history of the loan applicant is checked. Interest rates for personal loans vary. It is best to choose banks that offer flexible, affordable and convenient payment schemes.</p>\n<p>In the Philippines, it is not difficult to find credit providers. Many Filipinos survive financial difficulties through loans. The difference is the legitimacy of loan providers. Many people have no choice but to deal with loan sharks who charge very high interest rates if they are in dire need of cash. What’s needed is a link to connect a loan applicant with the right loan product. <strong>LoanSolutions</strong> resolves this problem. It has a network of bank and financing agencies and works by matching the profile of a loan applicant with the right loan product.</p><a href="https://quickapply.loansolutions.ph/apply?type=personal" class="btn btn-danger btn-lg">Start my Loan Application »</a>', 'SSS Loan Alternatives With Best Rates', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'get-sss-loan-alternatives', '', '', '2015-12-03 02:01:28', '2015-12-03 02:01:28', '', 0, 'http://localhost/wordpress/?p=64', 0, 'page', '', 0),

What’s needed is an access to these products, to let them be known to borrowers. This is how LoanSolutions comes in.</p>\n\n<h5 class="pt20">WHAT IS LOANSOLUTIONS?</h5>\n<p>LoanSolutions connects borrowers to the right loan products.

The adviser will also request for necessary documents and once requirements are completed, LoanSolutions will be the one to do the work of submitting these documents to the preferred loan provider. The adviser will update applicants if they are loan qualified, but the lender typically reaches the applicant directly.</p>\n\n<h5 class="pt20">HOW IT HELPS</h5>\n<p>LoanSolutions may not be a lending company but it has access to as many lending agencies and loan products by partnering with legit and reputable companies that offer a wide range of loan products.

Unlike a house that’s fixed on a lot, which is a real property, this type of loan is for things that can be moved. The lender would have the lien or right to the property until the loan has been fully paid. That’s the only time that the borrower will have full rights on its ownership. In case of default payment or if the loan has not been paid, the lender would have the right to sell it to compensate for the amount that has not been paid.</p>\n<p>Like any other loan, <strong>chattel mortgage terms</strong> vary from one lending company to another. If you’re considering getting this type of loan, it’s important that you look around and compare their terms to get the best one. The easiest way to do this is by using LoanSolutions.

And it’s a practical decision to secure funds for the baby’s delivery, apart from the money you and your spouse have probably saved up for this major event of your life.</p>\n<p>Getting a maternity loan isn’t really that difficult if you know who to call for advice and the considerations for application. For instance, prior to delivery, you may need to pay for consultation and vitamins. During the delivery, it’s necessary to prepare enough money just in case the doctor suggests to do Cesarean operation. Post-delivery, you need to consider taking in vitamins and supplements to recuperate faster. And that’s just for yourself, the baby also has his/her own needs, which include vaccinations and vitamins amongst others.</p>\n<p>In the Philippines, the SSS is the only government entity to offer maternity perks, which doesn’t necessarily equate to financial assistance. The SSS maternity benefit is primarily just extended leave credits of up to 60 calendar days. There is, however, a daily cash stipend given to mothers during the days they’re unable to work. Mothers undergoing C-section delivery can get an additional 18 days leave on top of the 60-day credits.</p>\n<p>SSS Maternity Benefits applicants should pass the following documents for loan approval:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Maternity Notification Form (received and stamped by SSS)</li>\n  <li>SSS Biometrics or UMID ID</li>\n  <li>Maternity Reimbursement Form</li>\n  <li>Employer Certification by the latest employer detailing the employee’s effective date of separation (applicable only to separate members)</li>\n  <li>Certificate that no advanced fees are given</li>\n  <li>Certified and authenticated copy of normal delivery record</li>\n  <li>Certified and authenticated copy of Cesarean delivery record</li>\n  <li>Obstetrical history showing records of miscarriage or complete abortion (if applicable)</li>\n</ul>\n<h5 class="pt20">How Loansolutions PH Can Help</h5>\n<p>Our aim is to make a positive change in the Philippines’ traditional lending industry.

In Manila, various types of loans are offered for different purposes. There are personal loans, housing loans and car loans. The money obtained from loans can already solve financial difficulties or be used to finance a major purchase that would be difficult to pay outright. Getting a loan in Manila used to be so burdensome. Banks and other financing institutions would require collaterals and co-maker as sort of security in case the loan is not repaid. However, these days, obtaining a loan is easier compared to how it used to before. With the many companies offering loans, institutions started to compete by offering lower interest rates and simplifying the requirements. Many of them do not require collaterals anymore. For as long as they prove that a borrower has means to pay, then the loan can be approved.</p>\n\n<h5 class="pt20">WE SIMPLIFY THE LOAN PROCESS</h5>\n<p>Our company understands the heavy financial burdens every Filipino has to go through.

We will serve as your matching site that connects you to the right loan product that best suits your needs and preference. While there are many attractive loan offers out there, the problem is not all borrowers are aware of their existence.

This leads us to the next option.</p>\n<p>Cash Advance or Payday Loan – This is the easiest to apply and get approved.

Pag-Ibig</h5>\n<p>As the country’s leading provider of housing development funding, Pag-Ibig also offers home repair and rehabilitation to victims of calamities. Applicant-victims can lodge their loans 90 days within the government’s declaration of areas under State of Calamity. Members can get up to 80% of their TAV, which may still depend on the programs terms. Interest rate comes at 5.95% per year with a 24-month amortization and 3-month grace period. Borrowers need to present the following upon application:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Duly accomplished Calamity Loan Application form</li>\n  <li>Proof of income</li>\n  <li>Photocopy of valid IDs (at least 2 IDs)</li>\n  <li>Declaration of Being Affected by the Calamity</li>\n</ul>\n<h5 class="pt20">2. SSS</h5>\n<p>SSS Calamity Loan is available only to families affected by calamities, which means the approval depends on government recommendations. After the 7.2 earthquake for instance, the government gives out loan packages to residents of Cebu and Bohol. The package includes an early salary loan renewal, advanced disability, SSS retirement pensions and survivorship and Direct House Repair and Improvement Loan with a lower interest rate.

For the G-W@PS, borrower will need to go to any G-W@PS kiosks and swipe their eCard Plus. Applications will have to follow manual application procedures when filing their loans in the office. To qualify for a loan, one has to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>be an active employee who hasn’t been on a Leave of Absence without Pay</li>\n  <li>have no administrative or criminal charges</li>\n  <li>have no loan declared in default</li>\n  <li>have no pending monthly contributions</li>\n  <li>be a resident of an area that’s declared under State of Calamity</li>\n</ul>\n<h5 class="pt20">Private Lending Firms</h5>\n<p>GSIS, SSS and Pag-Ibig depends on State of Calamity declarations, which means these only cater to specific individuals.

How can I qualify?</h5><p>Lenders have their own terms and qualification standards, especially in relation to the borrower’s income, employment status and purpose for the loan proceeds.  For instance, many providers release cash for emergency use (e.g., calamity loan, maternity loan) faster than those for other non-urgent use (e.g., vacation, business capital). But most lenders, though, would consider your application if you…</p><ul>\n	<li>… are 21 to 70 years old</li>\n\n	<li>… have proof of income or employment</li>\n\n	<li>… have proof of citizenship (both for Foreign and Filipino applicants)</li>\n</ul>\n<h5 class="pt20">2. What should I consider prior to getting a loan?</h5><p>As a short-term solution, it’s not advisable to make loans your primary financial net. However with the unpredictable situations we can get ourselves into sometimes, it helps to maintain a safe stance as to borrowing money. That means it’s important to consider the following aspects to ensure your loan won’t compromise your long-term goals:</p><ul>\n	<li>Interest Rate</li>\n\n	<li>Flexibility of Payment Options</li>\n\n	<li>Approval Time</li>\n</ul><h5 class="pt20">3. What are the documents and requirements I need to submit?</h5><p>In relation to the lender’s qualifications, they may are for additional documents such as the following:</p><ul>\n	<li>Proof of income (latest payslips for employed borrowers or business permit for business owners)</li>\n\n	<li>Valid IDs (preferably, company ID and Government IDs)</li>\n\n	<li>Proof of billing (Water or electricity bill with your name if you own the house or with your parents’ or relatives’ name if living with family or relatives).</li>\n\n	<li>Credit card statement (Optional – just to show your repayment behaviour).</li>\n\n	<li>Bank statement of account (Optional – just to support your other documents on income streams and capacity to pay)</li>\n\n</ul>\n<h5 class="pt20">4. Is it necessary to have an outstanding credit history?</h5><p>In the Philippine setting, there’s no unified credit history ranking system yet. Besides, fast cash loan lenders understand that borrowers want their money fast, which is why it’s optional for you to present credit status documents. However, they may have internal standards in evaluating your credit records. So to ensure fast approval, make sure to maintain a good credit rating.</p>\n<h5 class="pt20">5. How long should I wait to access the money?</h5><p>Fast cash loans are usually released in just a matter of days, if not hours, depending on the amount you’ve borrowed. CitiBank, for instance, releases approved loans in 2 hours. Besides, lenders also offer different receipt options, the most popular and convenient of which are via ATM and cash.</p>\n<h5 class="pt20">6.

In the past couple of years, banks and private lenders are still looking for ways to ensure their website is secure and capable enough in handling financial transactions.</p><p>But today, many providers are launching their online platforms for the public to use. So tech savvy or not, getting a loan online is worth the try for four major reasons:</p><ul>\n	<li>Get a loan anytime, anywhere (just as long as there’s Internet connection) – You can lodge your application right at the moment when you just got out of bed. There’s no need to primp up and look presentable, just as long as you have the documents to prove that you’re a responsible borrower.</li>\n	<li>\nEasy and fun – Online application is far easier and more fun than going to actual offices. You can do it simultaneously as you do your usual social media activities or do your research.</li>\n\n	<li>Convenient – Applying online is very borrower-friendly as you can do this just a few clicks of the mouse. No need to travel; no need to hurry. You can click the Submit button when you’re ready, without ever minding whether there’s a long line behind you.</li>\n\n	<li>Access to financial tools - You can access online financial resources such as interest rate calculators and comparison tools as you go through the application process. Plus, you can check out financial guides and look up loan terms you don’t quite grasp before pushing through the process. All these can help you make informed decisions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Those who consider themselves as not so much as a tech savvy might consider getting cash loans online as the exception. Security is a major consideration, though, to ensure you’re visiting a reliable online loan shop. You should use the Safe Search Mode if you’re just shopping around. Or better yet, ask recommendations from friends as to where best to get a loan online.</p><h5 class="pt20">Why Partner with Us</h5><p>But you don’t really need to look any further.

On such cases, it might help to know the tips and tricks on how to do this the right way. Specifically, the following 5 considerations are the must-knows for all applicants:</p><ul>\n	<li>Ways to ensure fast approval – When it comes to cash loan application, it’s really just the gathering of documents that takes time. Once your requirements are all in and you’ve presented a solid proof that you’re a qualified borrower, it should all be easy peasy.</li>\n\n	<li>Minimum requirements – Lenders usually demand borrowers to pass specific requirements, which usually depend on the amount of money you like to borrow, employment status and proof of citizenship. But if you have the following, you basically already have the basics:</li>\n</ul>\n<div class="table-responsive">\n    <table class="table">\n        <tbody>\n            <tr>\n                <td>- Proof of income (latest payslips or business cash flow report)</td>\n                <td>- ID pictures</td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n                <td> - Valid IDs with specimen signature</td>\n                <td>- Proof of citizenship or residence/td>\n            </tr>\n        </tbody>\n    </table>\n</div><ul>\n	<li>Traps and scams to avoid – Do your research and stay informed about the latest scam and fraud strategies targeting loan applicants. For instance, always think twice if the fee is necessary if you’re suddenly prompted to do so. Avoid entering your card details – be it debit or credit card – if it isn’t clear to you what it’s for. To ensure a safe and secure loan application, it’s best to partner with trusted firms as per friends or authorities’ recommendations.</li>\n\n	<li>Features to look for in a loan product – Rethink about what you really need. In this way, you’ll have a clear idea on what to look for from lenders. For instance, you might like to opt for cash receipt and repayment flexibility, lender support, rebate or low interest rate. It might also be great to know if it’s renewable after how many months.</li>\n\n	<li>Useful tools and resources – Search the Internet for useful resources and tools that can help you make sound decisions prior signing up to lenders’ terms. Know your responsibilities and rights as a borrower. You can also use loan calculators that will help you estimate interest rates, allowing you to decide how much exactly to borrow and set realistic goals for repayment.</li>\n</ul><h5 class="pt20">Who to Call for Help</h5><p>As a loan solutions company, <strong>Loansolutions PH</strong> understands how time-consuming it is to file for a loan all by yourself.

However, there are cases when both parties agree to make some adjustments to achieve consensus. The following, though, are the common items on the form that you should know:</p><ul>\n	<li>Amount to Borrow – Specify the exact amount you like to borrow and the corresponding interest rate per month or per annum. It’s also important to include the add-on fees.</li>\n\n	<li>Repayment Options and Plan – Set the monthly payment schedule, as well as the due date of the loan as per agreed with the lender. Usually, payments are made on a monthly basis, although there are some who prefer to pay as a lump sum.</li>\n\n	<li>Collateral – Set the type of asset you’ve put up as a way of ensuring the lender that he/she can still control of the agreement, even if you fail to pay. Valuable physical assets such as a car, house or piece of land can make perfect collateral.</li>\n\n	<li>Late Fees – Indicate the terms governing delayed payments. If the borrower misses a payment schedule, he/she will incur additional cost to be paid on top of the loan’s original interest rate. Meanwhile, lenders have the discretion to waive the late fee.</li>\n	<li>\nLoan Sales – Include a provision detailing the sale of your loan to another lender, should the original provider wouldn’t be able to deal with the deal anymore. The third party will buy the loan at a fraction of the original price and attempt to recover what it can.</li>\n	<li>\nConsigner – Include a co-borrower who will vouch for the borrower. This usually applies to younger borrowers who has limited or doesn’t even have any credit history.

Apart from these, the following are also some of the most common reasons for delays in approval time:</p><ul>\n	<li>Lack of documents or requirements – You will certainly encounter delays if you lack one or two necessary documents the lender demands. So to ensure fast processing and approval, prepare all your documents ahead of time. Discuss with the lenders clearly as to the type of files he/she needs to establish your credibility and capacity to pay.</li>\n\n	<li>Lender – Borrower misfit – Delays can also be due to misunderstandings and miscommunication between the lender and the borrower. There are times when it just takes more time to arrive at a common ground due to misaligned choices. Consequently, the best solution would be to get to know each other first prior to approval so that both parties will have a background on each other’s preferences.</li>\n\n	<li>Amount of money to borrow – Approval time may also depend on the amount of money the borrower plans to borrow. Of course, lenders will have to weigh out the gains and losses of investing their money on individuals. So they may end up considering a range of other factors prior to approval, such as purpose of loan proceeds, capacity to pay and credit history.</li>\n\n	<li>Lack of help from experts – Getting a loan on your own can become a very time-consuming task. You have to do your own research first to compare interest rates and other features. On top of that, you’ll still have to spend time gathering up your requirements. So to ensure fast processing, it’s best to ask recommendations from friends, financial experts and loan solutions providers – such as <strong>Loansolutions PH</strong>.</li>\n</ul><h5 class="pt20">The Loansolutions PH Difference</h5><p>The good news is, you don’t have to undergo the long, arduous process of loan application.

Equity is defined as the value of the property when debts and other obligations on it have already been paid. It means that a home’s equity is no longer burdened with debt that can impede its use as collateral.</p>\n\n<h5 class="pt20">HOME EQUITY LOAN</h5>\n<p>As already mentioned, you can use home equity meaning it can be put up as a security to your home loan without having to shell out additional cash to get approved. The higher the home equity is, the higher the amount of the home loan you can get. A home equity loan is just that. The owner of the home whose equity is to be used as collateral can determine how much of the home’s equity will be used as collateral. The owner of the home will now serve as the guarantor.</p>\n\n<h5 class="pt20">LOANSOLUTIONS WILL HELP YOU REALIZE YOUR DREAM HOME</h5>\n<p>Now that we have discussed equity meaning for house loan a form can now be filled out at Loansolutions so we can proceed with the succeeding steps in securing your home loan. With our help, you do not have to wait for years and years before you can own your dream home. Let us do all the legwork. As long as you qualify for our partner banks and lending companies, a few days is all you have to wait for before your loan gets approved and released. With the help of a home equity loan, you will have a new home sooner rather than much later in your life. Moving your whole family into your new home will give you the best feeling that you can ever feel. There is no greater feeling than knowing that your family is safe and sound under your own roof, and they are comfortable with their new environment. Loansolutions is your partner towards realizing your dream for your family. We take pride in the fact that we are instruments to bringing families homes that they can call their own.</p><div class="col-sm-12 btn-wrapper"><a href="https://www.loansolutions.ph/" class="btn btn-danger btn-lg">Apply at LoanSolutions Now! »</a>\n            </div>', 'Home loan equity: What it\'s meaning for family?', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'get-home-loan-equity', '', '', '2015-12-03 02:26:29', '2015-12-03 02:26:29', '', 0, 'http://localhost/wordpress/?p=125', 0, 'page', '', 0),

One of these advantages is the ease and speed of the process. You simply have to go the pawnshop, get your valuable assessed, and get the money. It’s basically a personal loan with the valuable as a collateral. Your credit background no longer needs to be checked. If you are of legal age, you are virtually always qualified to do pawn something at a pawnshop. There’s almost no waiting time except for the few minutes you have to wait for the assessment. Moreover, the paperwork is very minimal unless you are being asked to show proof of ownership.</p>\n<p>In terms of payments, you will not be bothered by a collector or you will not be pestered by collection notices. In fact, the pawnshop does not care if you are able to pay or not because they have your valuable with them. In almost all cases, the valuable you pawn costs higher than the amount loaned to you so it’s usually favorable to them if you no longer get your pawned item back.</p>\n<p>However, not everyone has an item that can be pawned. Similarly, not every place has a pawnshop to have something pawned at. That’s why you may have to look for an alternative lender. That’s what we at Loansolutions are here for. We can help you look for a lender that can address your needs at the best possible terms and interest rates. We strive to match you to a lender that offers loans comparable to the personal loans you can get from a pawnshop.</p>\n\n<h5 class="pt20">BORROW AN AMOUNT HIGHER THAN WHAT YOU CAN GET FROM A PAWNSHOP.</h5>\n<p>The pawnshop loan amount you can get is based on the value of the valuable or property you are pawning. Because of this, the amount you can borrow is usually minimal. If you need a bigger amount, you will have to look for another lender. Again, we at Loansolutions are always ready to provide assistance. We have partnered with several lending companies so we can easily connect you to lenders that can serve your needs. As much as possible, we find lenders that offer interests that are comparable to pawnshop rates.</p>\n\n<h5 class="pt20">QUALIFICATIONS</h5>\n<p>The single best advantage of pawnshop loans is the fact that your credit background and other circumstances are no longer being evaluated.

A fee would be imposed on the borrower for the transaction and loaned money and both must be paid in one lump sum, which summarizes how payday loans work. In the case of a pre-signed check, the lender holds the check until the promised date and until the borrower would redeem the check in his/her bank and pay the promised money to the company transacting the payday loanservices. Another common version of this transaction is when the borrower will simply sign the check together with the promised amount, and the lender’s name would be placed on the check for future redemption.\n\nIf a person is unable to pay the promised amount on time, they have the option of “rolling over” the payment at a later date. This would consequently charge a late payment fee together with an increased interest fee along with the loaned money.Payday Loanscharge a high interest rate and are advised to be used sparingly or during extreme financial emergencies due to the possible accumulation of fees from failure of paying on the promised date/s.\n\nCompanies who provide payday loanservices have also offered an online transaction option in their respective websites as well as further information on how do payday loans workin their outlets.This provides faster processing and pay-out.

How do loan interest rates work? Many people who have been borrowing money from banks and other lending firms don’t know how the interest rates work or affect the entirety of their loans. The interest rate is the percentage of the payable amount that is added periodically to the balance amount. It will continue to mount up until the debt has been completely repaid.\n\nThe bank or loan provider is following a computation in order to determine the interest rate depending on the amount borrowed. The computation of the interest rate is not that complex. The amount calculated for the interest rate is added to the principal amount borrowed. Thus, once you start paying for a loan, you’ll notice that it eventually gets a bit higher.\n\nThe interest rate greatly affects the payable amount. This means that if you’ll be paying the principal amount for longer period, then you should expect for higher interest rate. But, if you’ll pay in a shorter period, then the interest rate would be lower. The interest rate is computed using either simple or compound interest depending on the lending firm.\n\nIt is very significant for a borrower to understand how do loan interest rate work in order to eliminate confusions. This will also give you an idea on how much it would cost you in borrowing certain amount of loan. It’s also important for financial planning as well as repaying your debt.', 'How do loan interest rates work?', '', 'publish', 'open', 'closed', '', 'how-do-loan-interest-rates-work', '', '', '2015-12-21 03:45:33', '2015-12-21 03:45:33', '', 0, 'http://localhost/wordpress/?post_type=kbe_knowledgebase&amp;p=79', 0, 'kbe_knowledgebase', '', 0),

First, it relies on the asset being presented, then the annual percentage rate(APR) which is the interest rate in a yearly standpoint, the amount that has already been paid for the asset, and finally how much there is left to pay off. For instance, a home’s appraised valueis $200,000. The balanced owed on its mortgage is $100,000 and the amount paid is $100,000, wherein the amount paid is also the equity of the asset. An equity loanis then applied when the owner wants to loan the lump sum of the home’s equity for personal reasons. This may be used for a one-off payment such as unexpected medical bills or credit card debt. Once that is in place, a fixed interest rate is applied for the owner to pay off monthly. In this case, the interest rate is higher than that of the original but is tax deductible, thereby showing how equity loan rates are placed on the asset. The collateral used by the company is the house. From there, the equity is consistent throughout the agreed number of years the loan would be paid.If the owner is unable to pay at the specified date or exact amount, repossession or foreclosure would be placed on the house. Prior to applying for an equity loan, it is advisable to inquire about the current interest rate in order to have a clearer understanding of the situation. How equity loan rates fare also depends on whether or not the borrower has a consistent line of work to pay off the loan or the reason for the loan itself.', 'How equity loan work?', '', 'publish', 'open', 'closed', '', 'how-equity-loan-work', '', '', '2015-12-21 03:46:11', '2015-12-21 03:46:11', '', 0, 'http://localhost/wordpress/?post_type=kbe_knowledgebase&amp;p=81', 0, 'kbe_knowledgebase', '', 0) ;
